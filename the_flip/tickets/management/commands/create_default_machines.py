Rather than develop it from scratch, he looked to the popular magazine Ballyhoo—the MAD magazine of the 1930s—and simply used their colors and style.

For Blackout, Williams reached out to the painter Ed Paschke (1939–2004), who was an important member of the Chicago Imagists, a group redefining contemporary art in their own surreal style. Many Imagists were themselves influenced by pinball—as demonstrated by a 2017 exhibition at the Elmhurst Art Museum—and Paschke himself owned a Gorgar machine (Williams, 1979).

Unfortunately for Paschke, his avant-garde style was not what Williams wanted. After producing his concept painting for this machine, also titled Blackout (1980), the company thought it was too "far out." Its amorphous, masked astronauts, its multicolored cosmic rays, and its pock-marked green planet were too strange. The company tapped Constantino Mitchell—himself a student of Ray Yoshida, another Chicago Imagist—to redesign Paschke's painting in a more conventional style. But, according to Mitchell, "I want Ed Paschke to get credit for [the] Blackout backglass design. He did the original art concept. Ed Paschke was my teacher and mentor at the Art Institute of Chicago. His usage of color influenced me for the rest of my life."

Paschke went on to curate an exhibition of pinball art in 1982 at the Chicago Cultural Center with Mitchell's collaboration.

But operators complained about the difficulty maintaining it and players found it confusing, so it flopped, selling only 5,000.

Making use of the then-new dot matrix display (DMD), it did away with the permanent score displays prominent since the 1940s. Instead, a grid of LEDs was used to show not just scores but information and basic animations.

This era of machine also adds music and extensive sampled sound, creating a richer experience and helping them compete with video games. As compared with Eight Ball Deluxe, this also uses a third dimension with ramps and wireforms (aka habitrails). Earlier generation of pinball machines tended to reuse the same components with just visual changes, but from the DMD era forward, toys and features made for just one machine become common.""",

It uses both samples from the movie and custom audio recorded by Raul Julia. It was also the first pinball machine to make use of "artificial intelligence"; a simulated neural network drives the "Thing Flips" feature, where it automatically shoots the ball from the small upper left flipper to The Swamp on the right.

Also common is that Godzilla is based on licensed material. This provides an instant audience for the machine. Here, Stern made extensive use of the Shōwa era Godzilla films (1954-1975) to provide both a structure for the game and video clips to keep players engaged and bystanders entertained.""",
