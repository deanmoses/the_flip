"""Test fixtures for LLM prompt evaluation.

This module provides test cases for evaluating the Discord bot's
LLM classifier. Each fixture includes:
- Messages representing a Discord conversation
- Expected suggestions the LLM should produce

These fixtures are used by the eval_llm_prompt management command to test
prompt changes without modifying production code.

To add a new fixture, simply define a new module-level LLMTestCase variable.
It will be automatically discovered and included in ALL_FIXTURES.

Test Users:
    User.visitor1, User.visitor2 - Museum visitors
    User.maintainer1 through User.maintainer5 - Maintenance team members
