# Native dependencies that require system libraries or a specific Python version.
# These are separated from requirements.txt so environments without the
# necessary native toolchains (e.g. Claude Code web) can install the base
# dependencies without failure.
#
# - pillow-heif: HEIF/HEIC image support. Requires libheif-dev headers.
# - audioop-lts: Python 3.13 compatibility shim for discord.py voice.
#   Only needed on Python >= 3.13 (audioop was removed from stdlib).
