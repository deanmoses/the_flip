# Maintenance Workflow

This document describes the pinball machine maintenance workflows for the museum.

## Machine States

There's a big distinction in the maintenance workflows between machines in service, machines in the workshop, and machines in storage.

### 1. Machines in Service

Museum visitors must be able to report problems easily (such as via a QR code) and we want to jump on them quickly. These are the most urgent.

### 2. Machines in Workshop

These are generally multi-week projects. We'll go through a cycle of fixing things, testing, discovering more problems, and gradually knocking down the issues until it's in good shape. 

When you arrive and go over to a machine to get started, you want to know the recent history and remaining problems. 

It's a different sense of "problem" than the problem report. There might be a half-dozen issues (e.g., these three lights are out, the left flipper is sticky, sound board capacitors need replacing). On paper, it's a rolling checklist.

### 3. Machines in Storage

 These will have a maintenance history, and will fall under one of these states: 
  - **Unknown**: purchased but not inspected
  - **Broken**: bought with known issues, or we triaged it a bit but didn't have an open workshop spot
  - **Good**: we've worked on it a bunch until we're happy

## Crosscutting / Non-Urgent Projects

 There are sometimes crosscutting non-urgent projects.  Examples:
  - The big capacitors go bad over time, so on certain eras of machine we want to replace them all at once rather than waiting for individual failures
  - We will generally replace the elastics on a machine all at once
  - We will give a machine's playfield a really good cleaning.


## Checklists

 We would like to develop checklists for certain activities. Examples:
  - When we acquire a machine and get it back to the shop, a checklist for various things to inspect and do
  - One task that's suitable for new volunteers is cleaning a machine
  
  We want these to be living checklists, so that people can easily edit as they notice activities are missing or unclear. This probably means some sort of versioning.
