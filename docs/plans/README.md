# Plans

This folder contains design documents for significant changes to the codebase.

Each document serves two purposes:

1. **Planning**: Before implementation, describes the approach, trade-offs, and alternatives considered
2. **History**: After implementation, serves as a record of why things were built the way they were

Documents remain here whether the work is complete or not - they're valuable as architectural decision records (ADRs) that future developers can reference to understand design choices.
