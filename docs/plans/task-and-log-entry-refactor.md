# Task and Log Entry Refactor

## Overview

Right now, this system is geared towards unauthenticated museum visitors scanning a QR code on a machine and filling out a form to submit a problem report.  Authenticated maintainers do work and add Problem Report Updates to log their work.

We want to refactor the system to support the workshop and storage workflows as described in MAINTENANCE_WORKFLOW.md in addition to the existing problem report workflow.

## Current State

- `ProblemReport` model - mostly geared towards visitor-reported issues on machines in service, though maintainers *can* submit them
- `ReportUpdate` model - for maintainer updates on problem reports

## Goals

Support three types of workflows:
1. **Machines in Service** - visitors report problems (existing workflow)
2. **Machines in Workshop** - maintainers create TODOs and log work.  This update is aimed at supporting this workflow.
3. **Machines in Storage** - maintainers track condition and maintenance history.  This update isn't aimed at supporting this workflow.  It will come in the future.

## Data Model Changes

### Model Renames

**`Task`** (renamed from `ProblemReport`): represents both Problem Reports *and* Tasks
- Fields:
  - All existing `ProblemReport` fields
  - `type` (CharField with choices, default='problem_report')
    - `'problem_report'` = Problem Report (usually visitor-reported but can also be reported by a maintainer, urgent, created via the existing public form accesible via QR code)
    - `'task'` = Task (maintainer-created TODO, usually less urgent than a problem report)
  - `status` - keep existing open/closed (no new statuses)

**`LogEntry`** (renamed from `ReportUpdate`): represents Problem Report Updates, TODO updates, *and* standalone work logs
- Fields:
  - `task` - ForeignKey to `Task` (null=True, blank=True)
    - When `task` is None, it's a standalone log entry
    - When `task` is set, it's an update to that task
  - `maintainer` - **REMOVED** (replaced by many-to-many relationship)
  - `maintainers` - ManyToManyField to Maintainer (NEW)
    - Supports multiple maintainers working together on a log entry
    - By default, populated with just the creating maintainer
    - Creator can select additional maintainers who participated in the work
  - All other existing ReportUpdate fields remain

### Visibility

- All Tasks are visible read-only to public, no authentication required (existing behavior)
- All LogEntries are visible read-only to public, no authentication required (existing behavior)
- The public can create a Problem Report from the page accessible via QR code (existing behavior).  Keep the same visual display and labels; don't rename this form to Task.
- Authentication required to create Tasks or LogEntries from maintainer UI (existing behavior)

### Migration Strategy

1. Rename `ProblemReport` → `Task`
2. Add `type` field (CharField with choices, default='problem_report')
   - All existing ProblemReports become Tasks with `type='problem_report'`
3. Rename `ReportUpdate` → `LogEntry`
4. Make `task` (formerly `report`) nullable
5. Change `maintainer` from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField `maintainers`
   - For existing LogEntries, migrate single maintainer to many-to-many
   - Handle null maintainer case (some updates may not have a maintainer)
6. Update all foreign key relationships and related_names


## UI Changes

### Public-Facing Pages (QR Code Workflow)

**No URL changes needed:**
- `/m/<slug>/` - public educational page (QR code target) - no changes
- `/new_report/<slug>/` - problem report form (keep "report" in URL for public) - no changes

**Updates required:**
- `machine_public_view` - update to query `Task` objects filtered by `type='problem_report'`
- `report_create` / `report_create_qr` views - update to create `Task` with `type='problem_report'`
- `ProblemReportCreateForm` - update to work with `Task` model, automatically set `type='problem_report'`
- Templates keep all "Problem Report" terminology (no "Task" terminology for public)

### Maintainer's Machine Detail Page

Replace current "Report a Problem" button with two new buttons:
- **"Create Task"** - creates a Task (can be TODO or Problem Report style)
- **"Log Work"** - creates a LogEntry (optionally associated with a Task)

### Create Task Flow

Form should support:
- All existing problem report fields
- Created Tasks will have `type='task'` (marking them as maintainer TODOs)
- Same permissions: anyone can create (public or maintainer)
- Note: Public visitors creating via QR code will continue to create Tasks with `type='problem_report'`

### Log Work Flow

Form should have:
- Text field for work description (not required)
- Optional dropdown to associate with an open Task on this machine
- **Multi-select for additional maintainers** (NEW)
  - By default, pre-selects only the current user
  - User can select additional maintainers who worked on this
  - Shows all active maintainers
- Machine status change option (existing functionality)

### Display Changes

Machine Detail page should show three sections in this order:

1. **"Problem Reports"** - Tasks where `type='problem_report'` (visitor-reported, urgent)
   - Show status, date, problem type/text, reporter
   - Sorted by date (newest first)

2. **"Tasks"** - Tasks where `type='task'` (maintainer-created TODOs)
   - Show status, date, description, creator
   - Sorted by date (newest first)

3. **"Work Log"** - ALL LogEntries for this machine
   - Show date, maintainers, work description, associated task (if any)
   - Includes both standalone entries AND entries associated with Tasks
   - Sorted by date (newest first)

Keep existing status badges and UI patterns


## Legacy Data Import

### New Management Command

`python manage.py import_legacy_maintenance_records`

This replaces `create_sample_problem_reports.py` (but don't delete the old one yet).

**Data Approach:**
- Unlike `create_default_machines.py` which has legacy data hardcoded in Python, this command **reads CSV files at runtime**
- Legacy data stays in CSV format for easier updating and maintenance, no need to re-munge data if/when the CSV gets updated

**Data Sources:**
- `docs/legacy_data/Maintenance - Problems.csv`: these become Tasks
- `docs/legacy_data/Maintenance - Log entries.csv`: these become standalone Log Entries, not associated with a Task

**Import Rules:**
1. Respect dates from CSV (use `created_at` override)
2. Parse maintainer names and link to existing Maintainer records.  Exit with error if any maintainer cannot be matched.  Handle multi-maintainer entries (comma-separated in CSV).
3. The machines should already be created in `create_default_machines.py`.  Exit with error if any maintenance item references a machine that does not exist.

**CSV Columns:**
- Machine (string) - match to MachineInstance by name
- Date (datetime) - becomes LogEntry.created_at
- Notes (text) - becomes LogEntry.text
- Maintainers (comma-separated) - match to Maintainer records

## URL Structure

Current:
- `/reports/` - list all reports
- `/reports/<id>/` - report detail
- `/new_report/` - create report
- `/machines/<slug>/` - machine detail

Proposed:
- `/tasks/` - list all tasks (renamed from reports)
- `/tasks/<id>/` - task detail (renamed from report_detail)
- `/tasks/new/` - create task (renamed from report_create)
- `/machines/<slug>/` - machine detail
- `/machines/<slug>/log/` - NEW: create log entry

## Notes

- Keep existing QR code workflow intact (visitors can still report problems)
- "Problem Report" terminology stays in user-facing text for public visitors
- "Task" terminology for maintainers
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Keep existing rate limiting on task creation
