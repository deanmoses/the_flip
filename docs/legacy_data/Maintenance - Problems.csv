Hokus Pokus,"12/7/24, 12:00 AM","- On a 1-player game, it gives you 10 balls. And it won't start a two-player game unless you hold down the relay for longer than it would normally close. - The issue seems to be related to the second switch from the top on a relay with name something like ""2nd player select"", but that name doesn't appear on the circuit diagram. I tried cleaning it, without luck, and I also adjusted it to be tighter. But it'll work if I hold it closed while it's cycling.",,
"- I suspect something weird in the backbox, where the second-player state is represented. But I need a second person to fix it.",William,Checked,,
