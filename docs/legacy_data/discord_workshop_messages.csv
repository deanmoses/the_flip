Despite measuring fine it must have been leaking some current through, causing the upper rollover to read as always closed. Now, after clipping it off, all the switches and stuff register okay, but we need to add those caps back to all the original locations to ensure the full functionality (they weren't always registering in-game). Some other minor stuff will be adjusting the switches themselves, the plunger lane one for instance works but only if you push it below the playfield

Right now we have a few things on the wall, like the multimeter and logic probe. The stuff that's in the black bag is my travel kit, and I'd love to get equivalent or better stuff for the wall or a workbench. That would include:
* a soldering station (e.g., the [Hakko F888DX](https://hakkousa.com/products/soldering/soldering-stations/fx-888dx.html))
* solder (I think we got as far as Kester 0.8 mm Solder with lead)
* solder sucker ([SOLDAPULLT](https://www.amazon.com/EDSYN-The-Original-Deluxe-SOLDAPULLT/dp/B006GOKVKI) is the one I have in my cart)
* flux (Marco offers [this](https://www.marcospecialties.com/pinball-parts/77-FLX), but happy to order anything you like)

I did some looking into it yesterday and that station seems like the one to get (they discontinued mine and the DX is its successor).

Do we have isopropyl alcohol for misc cleaning already? If not, probably some of that. 91% should be fine",,2025/09/14 16:53,,,

Happy to get the power supply and scope, but we'll definitely need lessons on the scope. FWIW, I read good things about the Siglent and Rigol scopes last I looked. What sort of frequency and channels do you think we'd need? My theory was that we could go with one of the lowest-bandwidth scopes in that most of the stuff we'll be working on is old tech, but I'm pretty ignorant here.

My suggestions:
1. I was thinking of the existing collapsible workbench, the one with the variac on it, as the electronics workbench, so perhaps the solder station should go there.
2. General electronics stuff should go on the first right-hand pegboard, the one with the multimeter. There's also room on the shelves underneath for things that don't fit on the board.
3. If the oscilloscope ends up not on the electronics workbench, there's a soft-sided case for it.
4. I was thinking of the new folding worktable as something to put next to the middle machine, Star Trek. I noticed last week that people kept having to find places to put things down, so hopefully that will help.
5. As long as we're sorting out electronics stuff, it might be worth taking a pass at the molex bin and the assorted electronics parts box.
6. If anything needs labeling, the label-maker is on the righthand shelf in the clear bin next to the books. And saying that makes me think that maybe that should go on the wall somewhere too.

- The problem I started out with was that the ball lift motor was not working. It worked before I moved it.
- I got out the manual and ran through some self-test stuff. Everything worked except the sound and the ball lift motor.
- After some disassembly, I found that the ball lift motor wasn't connected. But where should of it have gone to?
- In the backbox there was a connector of the right shape but the wrong pins were hooked up.
- Tracing the wiring led me to discover that the speaker connector and the ball lift motor had the same connectors. The labeling on them were messy, so I had them hooked up incorrectly. Fortunately, the speaker connector was wired differently, so the speaker was unharmed.
- I hooked them up properly and labeled the motor connections. My label printer worked pretty well for that. I need to experiment more and start a policy of just labeling everything that could be ambiguous.
- Putting it back together went reasonably smoothly. Some of the balls looked a bit grubby, so I polished them all.
- It's now in working order! I played a game and the noise is a bit overwhelming. There are on-line mods for quieting things.",,2025/09/17 22:21,,,

Won't be here for this weekend, but surely for the next.

Which means I should explain how I deal with packages:
1. Look in the entryway on the Canalport side. There's no order, so you have to look at every single package.
2. Look in the maillroom. It's past the elevator and on the right behind some steel mesh doors. There's no order, so you have to look at every single package, but if we get lucky the'll place it on the shelves mid-way down on the right, where I put a sign for us.
3. Unpack the goods, and put them in a sensible place.
4. Post in here with a photo, so everybody knows there's something new and where to look.
5. Take the cardboard down to the trash room (around the corner from the elevator) and toss the cardboard in the recycling bins.",,2025/09/18 07:05,,,

* Star Trek is close to playable! We can't finish it until the capacitors in the Marco order arrive, but we can get close! The backglass, when we're ready for it, is wrapped up in padding and tucked in a corner.  I think Ken said it was tricky to get in, so we should look at what was making it sticky and fix it. Oh, and the adjustible feet are pretty rusty, so they may need cleaning or replacement. I think there's some iin the pinball parts box on the right shelf, and there are spare legs around too.
* Trade Winds is also close. The only things I know that t needs: 1) the kickout at the bottom, 2) getting the score motor working properly, c) figuring out what kind of glass it needs and ordering it from either a local supplier or somebody who will ship at reasonable price.
* Star Trip's left flipper coil melted. The replacement is behind the metal door at the bottom, along with the manual. It would be good to see if we can figure out why it stuck on. Also, the GI lighting doesn't work and I'm not sure why, but I suspect a bad transistor.
* Hyperball failed during the open house. The ball lift stopped working. As I mention in my notes above, one thing that can cause that is a simple connector problem.
* We still need a gift shop. I'm thinking something portable we can set up for open houses and pop-ups. The items are on the top shelf in the blue bin and nearby. I have [some prices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N3b2X9-6FEpq-j53Jl1VxLkp740Nb5_MzPM0YMmKjWk/edit?gid=0#gid=0).",,2025/09/19 20:19,,,

This and similar incidence probably are what caused it to burn off the sheathing.  But in the end the solenoid seemed good enough to reinstall.  I learned a bit about AC solenoids…namely that when activated they ALWAYS work to draw the core into the interior. They are not directional with voltage (obviously),,2025/09/20 18:23,,,

Things were done to it this morning; whoever worked on it before me, please chime in. But in the afternoon, I picked up Brian's attempt to figure out why certain lights weren't working. After some investigation, Caleb diagnosed it as oxidized connectors on the lamp driver board, so I cleaned the pins with alcohol and then put the connectors on and off. That eventually got everything going. Then the bonus **8** went out, and it turned out to be the more normal flaky socket failure.

Fussing with that got me to notice that some of the playfield inserts had come unglued, making them no longer level. For the most egregious ones, I used wood glue to put them back in place.

Then I thought, ""Ok, I'll play a game and make sure it's ok. But the game wouldn't properly start, and this turned out to be the kickout solenoid not working. So I ran a self test and discovered that the ordering was cuckoo. It would on fire one of the pop bumpers, but it would fire that one twice in a row. The first obvious problem I saw on related boards was that most of the weight of the big wire bundle in the middle was on the top solenoid board connector. And that bundle was all twisted up, causing other problems. So I unplugged a few connectors, rotated the bundle a few times, plugged everything back in, and tucked it into the strain relief loops.",,2025/10/04 18:10,,,

The self-test sequence failed at the last step, which the internet says often correlates with a problem with the 43v line. I took a look at the fuses, and one of them, F4, was blown. I double-checked and reseated all the connectors I had moved and tried again. I blew another fuse.

I thought it still might be a mis-placed connector problem, so I got out the wiring chart and verified that the right colors were  in the right places. I also noted that a number of connectors, old and new, didn't have the key holes blocked, so I added those. I also made a quick visual inspection of the solenoids, but didn't see anything amiss.

* They're in a bin by the fuse pullers on the electronics board

One problem here is that Star Trek was a 6-digit machine originally, but somebody put in a couple 7-digit displays. Another is that Player 1 has a digit out. I did some testing, and it looks like the voltage leaving one of the high-voltage transistors is too low to activate the digit; if I jump it to another digit transistor it's all good. So I suspect the display is fixable. But it's a 7-digit one.

* @Vivian noticed during a play test that some of the pop bumpers were scoring too many points, and in weird amounts.
* I verified that although the right pop bumper scored 100 points consistently, the other two scored more, and not consistently. I suspected something with the switch matrix such that it was ""bouncing"" such that one hit was multiplied
* This machine has both a diode and a capacitor on those switches (because of the switch matrix). I tested those and they seemed fine, or at least not any different.
* I then hauled out our shiny new oscilloscope to look at the switch matrix signals. They were hard to see, but they all looked the same to me.
* I put it in switch test mode and discovered that if I repeatedly hit the suspicious pop bumpers, switch 21 would occasionally register, which is one of the targets.
* more experimentation suggested that triggering those pop bumpers would often trigger those switches. But there was no switch matrix commonality.
* I looked for obvious electrical problems and found none.
* I disabled those solenoids (by pulling one of the jumpers on the solenoid board), and scoring was normal.
* I triggered the solenoids without triggering the pop bumpers and the problem persisted.
* Suspecting a mechanical issue, I grabbed the butt of a screwdriver and banged real hard on one of the solenoid brackets. This also produced excess points.
* I put paper between the switch contacts for the target. This also solved the problem. This made me pretty sure that it was just an issue of vibration.
* I grabbed one of the leaf switch wrenches and made the switch gaps a bit wider. The problem went away. Victory!",,2025/10/25 20:28,,,

The problem: mysterious noises that are hard to find, like buzzes and hums. My prime culprit here is the 1950s machines, which have some loud coils that are hard to track down.

The solution: a directional microphone that you can plug into your phone, meant for use with some application like [Spectroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.intoorbit.spectrum&hl=en_US), which shows you a time-series spectrogram. Plug the microphone in, start the app, and wave it around suspect areas, looking for correlations between your mystery sound and the colors of the spectrogram.

The microphone currently lives inside a rounded black soft case inside the box of assorted tools on the right tall shelf. The cable and adapter is in the netting in the case top. Brian, Caleb, and I tried it out yesterday and it seemed to work well enough.",,2025/11/16 10:12,,,

Or they can jump in and take a swing at fixing it, adding a log entry and perhaps closing the problem report when they're done.
3. For those looking to jump on a machine in the workshop, they can either look at the Machines page (where the ones that are actively being fixed are at the top) or the Log page (to see what's been done lately).
