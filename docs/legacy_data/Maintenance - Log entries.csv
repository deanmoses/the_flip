The Getaway: High Speed 2,8/2/2025 6:35 PM,"Test plays showed the spinny light at the top was only working erratically. We traced the wiring through the resistor board, the triac board, and back to the power board. It turned out that one of the jumpers had been incorrectly placed on the installation of the new board. We put it in the right spot and it started passing in the solenoid tests, where it is known as MARS. Reassembled and everything seems fine.",William and Diana

Hokus Pokus,7/19/2025 5:32 PM,"Left flipper button was soft and intermittently ineffective. Replaced missing screw, so force was centered. Disassembled leaf switch. Bent outer leaf to provide better button resistance. Bent other leaves to make it as responsive as the right. Reassembled and tested to work.",William
The Getaway: High Speed 2,7/19/2025 4:00 PM,"More detailed investigation. I did an extensive comparison of the states of the U1 pins.

The basic summary is that all the data pins show high with rapid change. The first 5 output pins on AF are steady low, but they're steady high on Getaway. The last one on AF switches from steady high to steady low when the flippers are enabled. My general take being that high means inhibit, and low means active.

As before, the OC pin is low for AF. For Getaway, it's high at U1 pin 1, but low at the connector (J113, p31). It's also high further back on the CPU board. Our initial theory was that maybe U1 itself was bad, but swapping for a new chip didn't help. However, grounding U1 pin 1 to pull it low does make the lights work. The problem is certainly on this board, so I'm sending it in for repair.",William
Star Trek,7/19/2025 10:58 AM,"Put legs on Star Trek, tested, found solenoids not firing, found blown fuse F1. Unknown cause of blown fuse, speculate board short.",
The Getaway: High Speed 2,7/12/2025 2:58 PM,"Did extensive probing and tracing of circuits based on previously mentioned guide.

Input voltages are fine. Some of the output voltages are fine. Tracing the flow across the board is fine, at least for the brown circuit. The clock signal is fine, as are the data pins.

But what's not fine is pin 1 on U1 on the power driver board, which enables everything. That's supposed to be low, but the logic probe says it's high. We traced that back from the processor board, looking at U5, and it's low. It's also low on the incoming connector. But it's high at U1. Our best guess it that it's the U1 chip, which has a socket, so we've ordered a replacement.","William, Ken"
Gorgar,7/5/2025 6:07 PM,"Carefully traced all outputs from old transformer, plus related wiring. What we have appears to be correctly wired.

Baseball,6/21/2025 4:08 PM,"Initial triage:

This won't be an easy one.

To lift the playfield, you need to loosen the top two bolts that secure the backbox. Then it comes right up.

The power layout on this one is deranged. The line cord needs replacing for sure, but even then this thing will be a nightmare. The switch on the front of the box is not connected to anything, but line current definitely runs to the coin door, which I'm not sure I can secure.

The first thing to do is to document everything. Lots of photos and some diagrams to indicate initial wiring. Then we should test the transformer with decent line cord and make sure it's behaving sensibly. From there it will probably take a good going through, backbox and main body, to get it close to functional.

It'll be a good project, but it's definitely a project.",William

Adjusted the second-from-top switch to be just right. But it's a narrow range between spinning forever and not going far enough. If this happens again worth asking on internet forums for ideas.

Gorgar,1/18/2025 12:00 AM,More cleaning,William
Gorgar,1/12/2025 12:00 AM,"- Tried powering it up.
- At first it was totally dead.
- There was a little of corrosion on the MPU board. I cleaned it with alcohol, but not perfectly. There was some corrosion on a chip above the battery.
- I traced the wiring, and there was a fuse missing right at the power cord. I replaced the fuse (using 8A, as that was what was in Addams Family).
- I tried turning it on and it came on with a clatter, including GI working and one of the solenoids firing. That shouldn't happen, so I turned it off.
- There was even more corrosion on the driver board. I wiped it up a bit, but it probably needs more. I put the MPU back in too.
- I went through a cycle of turning it off and on. MPU lights come on, and no clatter, but a very loud hum from the backbox.
- I left it on a little longer and the fuse blew, so I put together one of the mini-breaker fuse replacers. That was a pain, but it worked.
- More off on and off and I still couldn't find the source of the hum. definitely from the backbox, but hard to tell where from.
- next steps:
- study the wiring and figure out what all the fuses are
- pull the fuses to see which one causes the hum to stop",William
Addams Family,12/29/2024 12:00 AM,"The ball launcher was misbehaving. The outside spring had at some point fractured. I tried fixing it recently, and it was fine for a bit, but it was bad yesterday during the tour. Today I ended up removing one of the chunks, as it was getting tangled in the other and making things less elastic. Works for now, but I should replace it. And since there are problems unscrewing one of the screws, maybe better just to get a new assembly?",William
Teacher's Pet,12/29/2024 12:00 AM,"- symptom is that when the ball ends up in the bottom trough it doesn't cycle to the next ball and kick it out
- That seems familiar. How did I solve it before?
- It was adjusting the score motor wheel:
- We got the weird behavior where the ball eject wouldn't work to happen again. It was fine to start but got worse over time. We traced it to the score motor, index wheel, switch A, which gives power to the outhole switch that in turn triggers the end of ball cycle. It was finicky because it depended on exactly how far the score motor wheel advanced, and one of the two notches was more prone to cause trouble. Adjusting the switch leaf appears to have fixed it.
- I bent the switch just a bit more and it seems better.",William
Addams Family,12/27/2024 12:00 AM,"- There's something wrong in the swamp. I should go through all the switches there, and perhaps more generally.
- God, it's nice having something with decent built-in diagnostics. One of the swamp switches was erratic. But poking it was enough to get things working again. Was it a bit stuck? Was there some junk wedged there? Hard to know.
- I had also noticed a problem with detecting the ball waiting to be launched. That was a bit trickier. It turns out the plunger was sitting just a shade too far forward. The external spring was weird and janky. I tried taking it all apart, but one of the screws is stuck. The external spring was in two parts, and I tried separating them. They mashed back together pretty quickly. I tried a bit of tape, but that made the ball not launch or launch weekly. So I took the tape off and everything is somehow fine?
- Long term, I should get at least the screw and maybe a whole new assembly, complete with spring.",William
Hyperball,12/27/2024 12:00 AM,"- The problem I started out with was that the ball lift motor was not working. It worked before I moved it.
- I got out the manual and ran through some self-test stuff. Everything worked except the sound and the ball lift motor.
- After some disassembly, I found that the ball lift motor wasn't connected. But where should of it have gone to?
- In the backbox there was a connector of the right shape but the wrong pins were hooked up.
- Tracing the wiring led me to discover that the speaker connector and the ball lift motor had the same connectors. The labeling on them were messy, so I had them hooked up incorrectly. Fortunately, the speaker connector was wired differently, so the speaker was unharmed.
- I hooked them up properly and labeled the motor connections. My label printer worked pretty well for that. I need to experiment more and start a policy of just labeling everything that could be ambiguous.
- Putting it back together went reasonably smoothly. Some of the balls looked a bit grubby, so I polished them all.
- It's now in working order! I played a game and the noise is a bit overwhelming. There are on-line mods for quieting things. I should have some sort of policy there. A good item for the [[ChicagoPinbalMuseum/Newsletter]].",William
Hyperball,12/25/2024 12:00 AM,"- Got the backbox connectors set up.
- TODO get more durable labels for connectors.

- And I didn't have any immediate luck picking the door, so I guess I should go home.",William
Gorgar,12/25/2024 12:00 AM,"- The putty dried overnight and seems fine. I tried out the cover-up markers and either the gray or black will look best depending on how much the paint has faded.
- Now it's time to put it together. I think I want to go with Tom's suggestion of angling in screws from the sides to maximize the amount of wood involved. But i also want to do some angled in so as to hit the wood below. So let's go with side angles on top and down angles on the bottom.
- I'm a little scared of anything like this, as it's not reversible. But worst case I get more boards and cut them into shape. I don't want to be cavalier about making modifications, but this is the kind of thing nobody will notice, and there's no going back to the original, so I have to go forward.
- The screw plan worked.
- Held it in place with a ratchet strap and then the big clamps from the Worx workbench.
- Drilled holes and put in screws one at a time, initially out of caution and eventually because I didn't want misalignment.
- It was easy to over-sink the screws, but setting the drill's torque level to 5 was enough to get the screws mostly there, and 8 was enough to sink or over-sink them. At the end it was worth going very gently, including by squeezing the trigger just enough to
- Filled in with the DAP red-tube wood putty.
- initial tests with the Varthane grey and black markers look good. Once the putty has tried I'll go back and finish.
- It seems super solid. Without the vertical screws it was serviceable but wiggly; now it seems better than new.
- Cleaned out the bottom of the cabinet. There was a bunch of what I presume was poop, but much bigger than mouse poop, and round. This thing was clearly up on end for quite a while judging by the amount of dust and muck. There were also a bunch of loose parts and lengths of wire. I bagged them all up as possible pieces to the puzzle.
-
- Put on the backbox. Two of the bolts were pretty sticky. One I pushed at it and I think the fitting came loose. The other I didn't push, but it's not fully on. So:
- TODO remove backbox and inspect anchor points
- Took photos.
- I got this one to where I wanted it, which was upright and looking like a pinball machine. It has a ton of things that need doing:
- Compare the circuit boards to known-good photos.
- Especially compare the thing on the lower right to the square thing that could plug in there. I think it doesn't belong, but worth checking.
- Connect all the backbox cables.
- Do a smoke test.
- Make a list of all the electronics issues, and perhaps find a local expert to help with board work.",William
Gorgar,12/24/2024 12:00 AM,"- The first problem here is getting the backbox on top. That requires reattaching the wood that serves as a neck or riser or whatever.
- This was originally staple together, but poorly. Tom's suggestion was to use wood screws and filler putty.
- To get the old staples out I mainly hammered and pulled. But there were a couple I would have had to tear the cabinet apart to get to, so I used a Dremel grinding wheel and it took them right off. That left little nubs, but a bit more grinding took care of that.
- I did a test with his recommended screw, a number that's 1 1/2 inches long. I drilled with the 3/32nd bit and it was tough to hand screw but the screwdriver pushed it right in, including enough countersinking to fill. I'm trying out my fill; when I come back we'll see how it has done. Then I need to test the cover-up marker. But seems like good progress so far. I have also ordered some 2.5"" screws so I can sink from the top down to add some extra firmness and replace the staples I had to grind off.",William
Derby Day,12/24/2024 12:00 AM,"- Found the missing screw. It had bounced over to the wall/floor line and gotten wedged there.
- Fixed the 10k score stepper. It just needed some cleaning and everything started moving smoothly again.
- There was also a solder point that was broken; removing the 10k stepper made that easy to get to, so I fixed it too.
- Overall, it seems like it works now. Time to put it back where it belongs.",William
Gorgar,12/18/2024 12:00 AM,"The first problem is rebuilding the backbox riser. It was put together with 3/4x1/8 u-shaped staples, some of which were not put in particularly well. I've re-glued the parts of the plywood that were delaminating, and I've asked Tom for fastner advice.",William

Derby Day,10/12/2024 12:00 AM,"- It seems to be playing decently, but:
- TODO check and replace bulbs
- TODO is the 10k startup sequence right?
- When starting up, the 10k reset behaves oddly, going through more positions than necessary. Is that right?
- Took me a while to remember that the start solenoid doesn't trigger any switches, so it looks different on the diagram
- It seems to rotate through the zero positions, but never the nearest one
- There are 3 zero positions. Let's call them A, B, and C, which are at the 11, 3, and 7 o-clock spots.
- I did a few trials. Starting at 0A, it went to 0C 4/4. Starting at 0B, it went 2/4 to 0A and 2/4 to 0C. Starting at OC it went to 0A 1/2 and 0B 1/2.
- I notice that it sticks some. Hitting the 50k bumper causes 5 triggers, but doesn't always advance 5. It seems to be sticker around 12 oclock.

Derby Day,10/6/2024 12:00 AM,"- It gets caught in the startup sequence. So what do I see?
- I press the replay button.
- That energizes the Start coil, which changes the state on the Start/S relay pair
- That starts the score motor running
- It resets the horse sequence units with a switch on Motor 2D
- It loops on this forever
- If I force trip the S relay, then it
- resets the scores
- energizes the ball release coil
- that stays energized until I hit something that generates points
- from here the game plays as normal
- Also involved is the Z or Reset relay. That is triggered by the ""minus 1"" position on the 100,000 stepper. So I guess something kicks the reset solenoid on that?
- So what's the whole sequence?
- replay button
- start coil, flipping S switches
- disables the start button
- enables the score motor?
- both
- enables subtracting a replay
- resets the 100,000 to minus 1
- the 100,000 minus 1 switch triggers the Z/Reset relay, which
- triggers the ball release
- starts the score motor
- enables the flipping back of the S relay when the score motor hits 4C
- subtracts a replay at 1C
- activates the horse resets
- triggers the T and Counter relays
- When I started this debugging, I knew one of the switch stacks was bent way out of true. But I discounted it as probably irrelevant, because I thought it had to have been that way before. However, bending it back and fixing the switch alignment fixed the problem. I did adjust some wire positions, so maybe there was a compensating short?
- The machine is now back to being playable. There are a number of small things, one of which is that the backbox lights are a little off because the wood has worn or has bits missing. I used some putty to hopefully fix it.",William
Derby Day,9/15/2024 12:00 AM,"- It is looping on start. I'm pretty sure this behavior started before the move.
- We found a broken solder connection on one of the race position solenoids. But fixing that didn't help.
- lOne of the score motor switch brackets is wildly bent. I can't imagine that happening during the move, but I don't know what it could be. I may want to ask Matt.","William, Brian"
Teacher's Pet,9/15/2024 12:00 AM,"- Unfortunately, I think I failed to write up what we did! So where's it at?
- Brian came in to help, which has been great.
- We got the weird behavior where the ball eject wouldn't work to happen again. It was fine to start but got worse over time. We traced it to the score motor, index wheel, switch A, which gives power to the outhole switch that in turn triggers the end of ball cycle. It was finicky because it depended on exactly how far the score motor wheel advanced, and one of the two notches was more prone to cause trouble. Adjusting the switch leaf appears to have fixed it.
- Match wheel was a little wonky, so we took it apart. The screws holding the inner bracket to the main plate had worked their way loose. We tightened those, put the square circuit board back in its lowest position, and put it all back together. The shoes were correctly centered.
- After that there was a problem with ball advance. One part was a problem of ignorance; I thought the ball was advanced by the outhole switch, but it turns out it was a separate trough switch that registered the ball moving to the plunger area.
- The last issue today was a flaky T. Cleaning the related Jones plug helped some, and pinching the female Jones plug a bit helped with the rest.
- There's still a chance either that switch or the score wheel will need tweaking, but for now we put it back.","William, Brian"
Teacher's Pet,8/24/2024 12:00 AM,"- Back at it, starting with the start button, which they know as the replay button
- Button itself works.
- Next stop is the replay unit zero switch, which should block the signal if there are no credits, but it passes through regardless. Maybe the switch was bent as a cheap way of making it free play?
- Then it splits
- Green wire goes to the lock relay, on a switch marked normally closed but that's open whenever the power is on
- Also goes to the Game relay, green (although diagram says black) and then brown out. That's marked as normally open
- One problem was the game relay switch was not closing properly. We cleaned that and adjusted it and you can now start a game.
- However, the eject only works intermittently because the outhole switch is not always powered. This can be seen by connecting a meter between the black line on the solenoids and the top of the outhole switch.
- When this happens, the score relays are still powered, suggesting the problem is in the wiring near to that.",William
Teacher's Pet,8/17/2024 12:00 AM,"- What's this thing's deal? It's not starting properly.
- Let's just trace the power through the circuit diagram.
- Reset relay - operates when start button is pressed. Looks like power comes out on a dual switch with red/yellow weave wire.
- Tilt relay - from the diagram, it looks like it goes to a dual switch, the normal side of which should pass through, and the momentary side should go to the game relay
- the tilt relay flips at power on, which is pretty wrong. Isn't it?
- It flips because there's something on the lock relay that starts that way. If I disable the switch, it doesn't happen. And sometimes it doesn't happen regardless. And if it doesn't happen, then you can't start a game.
- Anyhow, the power did not pass through the tilt switch to the game over relay. Fixed and verified with a meter. But that didn't fix anything, so that was a problem, but not the problem. So what's the problem?
- Let's try looking from the start button forward.
- I can't find the start button. But it only works when the machine is tilted.
- Wait, no. It only works when the game relay is tripped. Can I find it from there?
- The start button is called the ""replay switch"". I think the theory is that normally just putting a coin in starts the game, and there are no credits, just replays. Credits must have come later.
- So that passes through the following:
- replay unit zero, normally closed. So zero credits opens it.
- or gate
- lock relay, normally closed
- game relay, normally open
- 25c relay
- ending up in the replay relay.
- What if I just trip that relay?
- It does something like a startup sequence, and then does not work. What trips the kicker?
-",William
Teacher's Pet,7/28/2024 12:00 AM,"- Started out with no power. I was expecting a complicated problem with relays. But the switch connector, which looks to be a bit of hack, fell off. I put it back on and adjusted it some.

Derby Day,5/11/2024 12:00 AM,"- I perused the schematic and found a number of things that would keep the score motor running. It looks like the start relay was staying on, perhaps because it was stuck or because the reset start relay wasn't firing. I poked it and things got better.

Teacher's Pet,4/27/2024 12:00 AM,"- I fixed the problem with the outhole switch. Turns out that it was getting about 5V from who knows where, and about 8V from a switch on the switch stack that was only partly closed. If I manually closed it, it would get 29V. Filing it didn't help, so I adjusted the switch a bit.

Teacher's Pet,4/23/2024 12:00 AM,"- The score motor was running for mysterious reasons. It would never start on its own, but it would keep running long past when it should have stopped. I found it on the circuit diagram and there were a bunch of things that could start it off. I tried those, but they all had other effects that would only happen the first time. But the score motor knows to keep running to complete a cycle. How? On one of the switch stacks (""index""), there's a normally-open switch that when it closes keeps the motor running until the next proper stopping point. That was opening, but the momentum of the system would keep it running through the stopping point. A small amount of friction or pressure on the switch stack would get it to behave, so I just adjusted the switch a bit and all was well.
- Next up is the mysterious outhole failure.
- It used to work fine. For a while I think it worked erratically. Now it only works if you hit something else, like the one-point bumper, while the outhole switch is depressed.
- The outhole switch is mechanically and electrically fine.
- The voltage at the switch normally is ~8V, dropping to 0 when the switch closes. If the machine doesn't have a game going, it's at 5V. If I push the one-point bumper, it peaks at 22V before dropping back to 8V.
- When I kick it off manually, the relay measures at ~28V. But without it, it's at 0.
- Holy shit, it's the same index stack of switches. For reasons I don't get, the outhole switch and the score EOS switches are all fed through a normally-closed switch on the score motor index wheel. If it goes slightly too far, the switch isn't properly closed, and so is at too low a voltage. If I move the wheel back to the proper closed position, the normal voltage is 28V.
- Since both these problems started at the same time, could there be a common cause? Why is the score motor going slightly too far now? Or is it going the right distance, but the switches were adjusted for the old distance?
- Time to clean up, so we'll find out next time!",William

- Took a while, but they came out great
- Next, the ball count unit
- This is a weird one. When I found it, both the tension and ratchet advance springs were over-tightened. 7 turns for the tension spring. The ratchet advance spring had been shorted.
- I disassembled and cleaned the axle and the contact points. That seemed to help, but when I put it back together, it was still not moving freely.
- After a few more passes, I realized that it moved poorly if the nut was tight. This is odd, because the similar unit has some play in the axle even when fully tight.
- I thought maybe the axle/toothed wheel thing was bent, causing a wobble. But I put it in my drill and it's reasonably symmetrical when it spins.

- For the power cord, it comes into terminals at the back. I want yellow to be hot and black to be neutral, as that way if the fuse blows the smallest area is hot. For the new cord, the ribbed side is neutral. So the new thing is yellow->smooth, black-> ribbed.

- Except that one of the flipper buttons was sticking, and one of the flippers was changing position a bit.
- For the position thing, I tightened the screws on the flipper shaft, but I remember it was pretty chewed up, so I ordered another flipper in case that doesn't hold.
- For the sticking, I assumed it was the flipper mechanism, but it was the flipper button. Sarah and I took one off and it was grubby! We started cleaning it and Gabe got involved so we took the other one off too. It took lots of scrubbing and a little bit of sanding, but they both came out fine.

- The match problem was indeed a bad socket. I took it out to see if I could repair it, but I can't even figure out how it works, or if it ever worked.",William
Hokus Pokus,1/20/2024 12:00 AM,"- This one is really close! I think the alternator is the last thing.
- What I'd expect it to be connected to is an odd/even output on the 10s score wheel. What it's actually connected to is ""00-90 UNIT CAM SWITCH"".
- The wire is supposed to be blue with white. And that's what goes into the alternator. And then in the backbox there's a different blue with white, which goes to the 4 on both reels, so I guess that's right? But when does that light up? Let's see what I can find on the schematic.
- Ok, there's something called the 00-90 UNIT DISC, which has two 0-9 boards, a solenoid that moves things along and establishes a relationship between the boards, and a switch that looks like it alternates every tick. So maybe this should get activated when we want to match or alternate and this isn't working?
- Actually, it was working! It swaps every 10-point step, more or less. I have questions about how it resets and works when players change, but ignore that for now. The alternator switch alternates! Why doesn't it work?
- At first I thought, ""This is an odd switch, it only has one wire coming in. Does it work off the solenoid that it's attached to?"" But no, it's just that the portion of the switch blade that connects to the yellow common wire got broken off. It was hanging right there, and I think I even noticed the odd floating junction before. So how do I repair it?
- The switch itself doesn't come all the way apart; maybe parts have mushroomed over time. So ideally, I'd just find a way to reattach something. Thin metal? Foil? A jumper? The original switch? Let's see what we have.
- Turns out this has broken and been repaired before. They had added a yellow jumper wire to the broken tab and then just put the wire into the switch body. It looks like over time that had broken off. Which makes sense; this has to be one of the most vibrate-y places on the machine.
- What I really should do is replace the switch blade entirely, but that would require having a new switch blade and also figuring out how to free the blade from the apparently-grown plastic. What I actually did was just to put the wire into the switch in the same spot, after removing the old copper bits.
- That's a bit of hack, though. This clearly didn't hold forever before, so I should do it right eventually.
- Ok, maybe match doesn't work?
- Well, it works better now, but the doodad is still sticky, and one or two of the bulbs won't light, either due to bad sockets or bad wiring.
- Specifically, the 20 doesn't work. Power gets to the socket, but a new bulb won't light, so I may want to replace the socket. But it's stapled in, so I'll need to find a new way of attaching it.",William
Teacher's Pet,1/13/2024 12:00 AM,"Found some scrap wood, got it up to an approximately playable angle. Seems much better than waiting. I can at least work on it next.

Hokus Pokus,1/13/2024 12:00 AM,"- Seems like it's in very good shape. The double bonus light is kinda dim, but the bulb and socket look fine and the plastic lens is clean. Probably looks better when not under a bright lamp.
- Tried some more backglass stabilization. This time I'm focusing on using the cuticle pusher to lay down a pretty thick layer of glue and the cotton-tips to squish things down without breaking up the paint more than necessary. We'll see how it looks, but it feels better. Still hard not to create a bigger mess, especially if something is still partly attached.
- Still doesn't look great, though. Lots of small misalignments. Better than falling off, though.
- There's definitely something up with the special outlanes after doing ABCD twice. Not sure what's going on, but the lights don't go on and the alternator doesn't appear to be alternating.
- I spent a long time staring at the circuit diagrams and then tried cleaning the extra ball relay. That got the SPECIAL lights to light, except that the alternator doesn't yet alternate. The alternator coil is connected to the ""00-90 unit cam switch"", and what I'd expect it to do is be one way on the odds and another on the evens. If I traced the wire correctly, it's linked to the 4 digit, which seems wrong, but I'm not sure if that's ""I traced it wrong"" or ""they built it wrong"" or what.
- That, or something, made the left outlane start scoring 1000 points. And I thought the right didn't work but got working first? A puzzler.
- The yellow open-gate target was just too hard to hit. I tried adjusting it in situ and only accomplished shorting the 1000-point relay. So then I took the whole thing apart to get it out and discovered that I could have just removed the light bulb behind the target/switch and it would twist out. Eventually, though, I got it back together. Hooray for pictures! And after a couple more tuning passes, it actually seems to work about right.",William

- The flakes are very hard to work with.
- If I don't get glue on the whole piece, I end up with a gap filled with fuzzy/frosty stuff, which I think is the glue vapor.
- When I press down on a flake, it frequently shatters, making the placement problem harder.
- It seems important to clean the glass before gluing, but also is quite challenging.

Hokus Pokus,11/25/2023 12:00 AM,"- The 2 player mode started working for no obvious reason. Also, the credit and coin relays, which would previously close briefly twice now close longer just once. That suggests there was some sort of self-latch via the score motor.
- The double bonus for ABCD works, but the lamp socket is bad. I'll need to order some new ones.
- The 100-point chime stopped working. It appears that one of the wires in backbox has failed, but that seems entirely improbable. Maybe it's a solder joint at the Jones plug female socket? I'll tackle it next time.

Hokus Pokus,9/26/2023 12:00 AM,"- Left flipper was weak

- There was some old duct tape on the EOS switch, which had dried out
- I noticed the left EOS switch was not sparking, but the right one was
- Did some searching. One Pinside thing mentioned that EOS switch failures cause weak flippers.
- I jumped it and it was fine. So I cleaned the switch and it worked.
- What was going on here?
- [This page](https://www.funwithpinball.com/learn/flippers-coils-and-power) has a good explanation. There are two coils, high power and low power; the former pushes and the other holds. The EOS switch, which is normally closed, gives the power a path around the low-power coil. But when it kicks open, all current is forced through it, reducing the flow in the high power coil and fully activating the low.
- The coil in question is an AF-25-500/28-1000 Bally coil. So that's 25-gauge wire with 500 turns for the high power coil, and 28-gauge wire with 1000 turns for the low. Per [this chart](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/wirega.html), that's 32.7 ohms/1000 foot versus 64.9. So 4x the resistance.
- I suspect that somebody originally just taped it closed, which worked but risked flipper burnout if you held the button in. A great example of short-term thinking of the ignorant sort.",William

 collapsed:: true
- I need to practice my soldering.
- My iron is fine for electronics. But for the line voltage wiring, it took forever to heat large joints.
- On the transformer lugs that was a problem, as I somehow softened whatever held the lugs to the rest of it. It worked out ok, but let's not do that again.
- Connecting it was a challenge partly because it was tight and partly because the original cord had two black wires and one green wire. According to an EM forum, the hot/black wire goes to the switch side.
- Putting that together seemed to work. The hold relay came on drawing the right amount of power, and jumping the score motor still worked.
- I then put it back together. I had misplaced a screwdriver and was worried I had left it under the board, which was a pain to check. I really want a repair bay with all the tools having places and labels, plus a small table for current in use tools.

- The 10-point issue was interesting. Just by poking I traced it to the left spinner. It turns out that the switch appeared to be triggering when the blades touched or were too far apart. Which is bonkers. And when I was fiddling with the spinner itself, I would sometimes get small shocks! Eventually I noticed that the screw for the left support was through the wood and possibly touching the common wire for the GI lamps. Taking the screw out made it work.

Hokus Pokus,9/19/2023 12:00 AM,"- Score motor did not run, even with jumpered power. But watts did jump, so perhaps it was stuck?
