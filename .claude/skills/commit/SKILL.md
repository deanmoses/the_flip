# Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

## Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

## Types

- `feat`: User-facing features or behavior changes (must change production code)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (must change production code)
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: CI/CD, tooling, dependency bumps, configs (no production code)

## Scopes

Optional. Use when it adds clarity. Examples: `accounts`, `maintenance`, `catalog`, `parts`, `discord`.

## Examples

```text
feat(maintenance): add infinite scroll to problem list
fix(catalog): correct machine slug validation
refactor(accounts): simplify maintainer profile loading
chore: add husky pre-commit hooks
docs: update API documentation
test: add tests for problem report flow
```

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see staged changes
2. Analyze the changes and determine the appropriate type
3. Write a concise description (under 72 characters)
4. Add body only if the "why" isn't obvious from the description
